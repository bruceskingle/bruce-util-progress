# Releasing bruce-util-progress

How a version of bruce-util-progress is published to crates.io. A published version can never be changed or removed,
only yanked, which stops new projects from choosing it, so everything is checked before `cargo publish`. These are
the steps by hand, until bruce-method-release does them.

## Names

- **`vX.Y.Z`**: the branch a version is developed on, with `X.Y.Z` in `Cargo.toml`.
- **`releaseX.Y.Z`**: the annotated tag on `main` of the commit published as `X.Y.Z`.
- **`main`**: only releases, each one a squash merge of its branch.

After each release the next version's branch, `vX.(Y+1).0`, is started from `main`. A fix to a released version is
made on a `vX.Y.(Z+1)` branch from its tag, only when one is needed.

The crates.io account and token are set up once, see bruce-db's
[docs/Release.md](https://github.com/bruceskingle/bruce-db/blob/main/docs/Release.md).

## Each release

The checks, which CI runs too, see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, except clippy and the dry run, then push:

```sh
cd ~/git/bruce-util-progress
git switch v0.1.0
git status --short
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo test
cargo deny check
cargo publish --dry-run
git push
```

Squash merge the branch to `main` with a pull request, tag `main`, and publish from the tag, so that the tag, `main`
and the published crate are the same commit, which crates.io records in the package's `.cargo_vcs_info.json`:

```sh
gh pr create --base main --head v0.1.0 --title "V0.1.0" --body "Release 0.1.0"
gh pr merge v0.1.0 --squash
git fetch origin
git tag -a release0.1.0 origin/main -m "bruce-util-progress release0.1.0"
git push origin release0.1.0
git switch --detach release0.1.0
cargo publish
```

Check https://crates.io/crates/bruce-util-progress, and its documentation on https://docs.rs/bruce-util-progress,
which builds within a few minutes.

Then start the next version's branch from `main`, with its version in `Cargo.toml`:

```sh
git switch -c v0.2.0 origin/main
# version = "0.2.0" in Cargo.toml
cargo build
git commit -am "Start v0.2.0"
git push -u origin v0.2.0
```

## A fix to a released version

On a branch from the release's tag, released as above, its pull request squash merged to `main`, which holds the last
release, then merged into the branch being developed, so that it has the fix too:

```sh
git switch -c v0.1.1 release0.1.0
# version = "0.1.1" in Cargo.toml, the fix, then the release as above
git switch v0.2.0
git merge origin/main
```

## 0.1.0

0.1.0 was published from the branch on 10 November 2026, before this order was settled, and tagged on 11 November.
`main` was fast forwarded to the tag, rather than squash merged, so that the tag, `main` and the published crate
are the same commit, as after any other release.

## Crates which use it

A crate depends on the published version, e.g. `bruce-util-progress = "0.1.0"`, and, to work on both, a git-ignored
`.cargo/config.toml` in its checkout points at the checkout next to it, which is taken out again once the changes
made with it are released:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
bruce-util-progress = { path = "../bruce-util-progress" }
```
